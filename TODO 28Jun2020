0. Dataset loading and getting all the data in an understandable format.
	Plotting it. - done 
1. Mutate time series - better outliers. - done 
2. Extracting Features from time series.
	Stationarity check
	Stationarity transformations - differencing and power transformations.
3. PCA on features - reduce dimensions to a subspace of n dimensions - get ones with largest variance
PCA - 
	Taking the whole dataset ignoring the class labels
	Compute the d-dimensional mean vector
	Computing the scatter matrix (alternatively, the covariance matrix)
	Computing eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues
	Ranking and choosing k eigenvectors
	Transforming the samples onto the new subspace
4. Try LDA if classes are known
5. STL decomposition of timeseries - 
	Analyse residuals.
	If > threshold then outlier
	Find a dynamic way to calculate threshold.
6. Model time series using AR
7. Model time series using MA
8. Model time series using ARMA and ARIMA and SARIMA, ARFIMA, Box-Jenkins
	
AR
MA
ARIMA
SARIMA
Forecast, calculate actual - pred then check against threshold

STL 
check residuals against threshold,

Threshold detection:
SD +- 3d - z-score 
Median Absolute Deviation
Interquartile range

Scikit learn
OneClassSVM, Isolation forest and LOF
